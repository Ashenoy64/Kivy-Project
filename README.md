# Kivy Project

Welcome to the Kivy Project! This is a small and simple project I created while learning the Kivy framework.

## Description

The Kivy Project is a Python-based application that showcases the capabilities of the Kivy framework. Kivy is an open-source Python library that allows you to create cross-platform applications with a natural user interface. As a part of my learning journey, I developed this project to explore the features and functionality of Kivy.
